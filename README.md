## Building

1. Make sure you have at least version 1.14 of Golang for proper module support. You can get by with go 1.12 or 1.13, but YMMV.
2. To make sure that internal includes (the vipconfig and the checker package) are satisfied, place the base directory of this project properly into your `$GOPATH`.
   The resulting location should be `$GOPATH/src/github.com/cybertec-postgresql/vip-manager/`. The easiest way to do this is:
   ```go get github.com/cybertec-postgresql/vip-manager```
3. Build the binary using `make`.
4. To build your own .deb or .rpm, `fpm` is required.
   Install it, add it to your path and try running `make package`, which will generate a .deb package and will also convert that into a matching .rpm file.
> note: on debianoids, rpmbuild will be required to create the rpm package...

## Installing from package

You can download .rpm or .deb packages here, on the [Releases](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/vip-manager/releases) page.
On Debian and Ubuntu, the universe repositories should provide you with vip-manager, though the version may be not as recent.
> NB! Our .deb is probably not compatible with the one from those repositories, do not try to install them side-by-side.

## Installing by hand

* Build the vip-manager binary using `make`.
* Copy the resulting `vip-manager` binary to `/usr/bin/vip-manager`.
* Install service file from `package/scripts/vip-manager.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`
* Install configuration file from `vipconfig/vip-manager.yml`  `/etc/default/vip-manager.yml`
* Edit config to your needs, then `systemctl daemon-reload`, then `systemctl start vip-manager`.

## PostgreSQL prerequisites

For any virtual IP based solutions to work in general with Postgres you need to make sure that it is configured to automatically scan and bind
to all found network interfaces. So something like `*` or `0.0.0.0` (IPv4 only) is needed for the `listen_addresses` parameter
to activate the automatic binding. This again might not be suitable for all use cases where security is paramount for example.

## Configuration

The configuration can be passed to the executable through argument flags, environment variables or through a YAML config file. Run `vip-manager --help` to see the available flags.

> The location of the YAML config file can be specified with the --config flag.
> An exemplary config file is installed into `/etc/default/vip-manager_default.yml` or is available in the vipconfig directory in the repository of the software.

Configuration is now (from release v1.0 on) handled using the [`viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper) library.
This means that environment variables, command line flags, and config files can be used to configure vip-manager.
When using different configuration sources simultaneously, this is the precedence order:
- flag
- env
- config

> So flags always overwrite env variables and entries from the config file. Env variables overwrite the config file entries.

All flags and file entries are written in lower case. To make longer multi-word flags and entries readable, they are separated by dashes.

> e.g. `retry-num`

If you put a flag or file entry into uppercase and replace dashes with underscores, you end up with the format of environment variables. To avoid overlapping configuration with other applications, the env variables are additionall prefixed with `VIP_`.

> e.g. `VIP_RETRY_NUM`

This is a list of all avaiable configuration items:

| flag/yaml key     | env notation          | required  | example                   | description |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
`ip`                | `VIP_IP`              | yes       | 10.10.10.123              | The virtual IP address that will be managed.
`netmask`           | `VIP_NETMASK`         | yes       | 24                        | The netmask that is associated with the subnet that the virtual IP `vip` is part of.
`interface`         | `VIP_INTERFACE`       | yes       | eth0                      | A local network interface on the machine that runs vip-manager. Required when using `manager-type=basic`. The vip will be added to and removed from this interface.
`trigger-key`       | `VIP_TRIGGER_KEY`     | yes       | /service/pgcluster/leader | The key in the DCS that will be monitored by vip-manager. Must match `<namespace>/<scope>/leader` from Patroni config. When the value returned by the DCS equals `trigger-value`, vip-manager will make sure that the virtual IP is registered to this machine. If it does not match, vip-manager makes sure that the virtual IP is not registered to this machine.
`trigger-value`     | `VIP_TRIGGER_VALUE`   | yes       | pgcluster_member_1        | The value that the DCS' answer for `trigger-key` will be matched to. Must match `<name>` from Patroni config. This is usually set to the name of the patroni cluster member that this vip-manager instance is associated with. Defaults to the machine's hostname.
`manager-type`      | `VIP_MANAGER_TYPE`    | no        | basic                     | Either `basic` or `hetzner`. This describes the mechanism that is used to manage the virtual IP. Defaults to `basic`.
`dcs-type`          | `VIP_DCS_TYPE`        | no        | etcd                      | The type of DCS that vip-manager will use to monitor the `trigger-key`. Defaults to `etcd`.
`dcs-endpoints`     | `VIP_DCS_ENDPOINTS`   | no        | http://10.10.11.1:2379    | A url that defines where to reach the DCS. Multiple endpoints can be passed to the flag or env variable using a comma-separated-list. In the config file, a list can be specified, see the sample config for an example. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:2379` for `dcs-type=etcd` and `http://127.0.0.1:8500` for `dcs-type=consul`.
`etcd-user`         | `VIP_ETCD_USER`       | no        | patroni                   | A username that is allowed to look at the `trigger-key` in an etcd DCS. Optional when using `dcs-type=etcd` .
`etcd-password`     | `VIP_ETCD_PASSWORD`   | no        | snakeoil                  | The password for `etcd-user`. Optional when using `dcs-type=etcd` . Requires that `etcd-user` is also set.

`retry-after`       | `VIP_RETRY_AFTER`     | no        | 250                       | The time to wait before retrying interactions with components outside of vip-manager. Measured in ms. Defaults to `250`.
`retry-num`         | `VIP_RETRY_NUM`       | no        | 3                         | The number of times interactions with components outside of vip-manager are retried. Measured in ms. Defaults to `250`.
`etcd-ca-file`      | `VIP_ETCD_CA_FILE`    | no        | /etc/etcd/ca.cert.pem     | A certificate authority file that can be used to verify the certificate provided by etcd endpoints. Make sure to change `dcs-endpoints` to reflect that `https` is used.

### Migrating configuration from releases before v1.0

As stated above, the configuration method has been changed from v1.0 onwards.
The breaking changes with regards to config handling are thus:
- Config flags are no longer prefixed with a single dash `-`, but in POSIX style with double dashes `--`.
- Some config keys have received new names, but the value handling has not changed.

However, some consideration has been made to ease migration:
- The old key names in VIP_* environment variables and in YAML config files are mapped to the new keys, a deprecation warning will be emitted for each old key that is used.
- If both old and new key names are used and have different values, vip-manager will exit; If both values are identical, the duplication will be ignored.

This means that migration should be pretty straight forward.

#### Migration for Service Files using Environment Variables

> These Service Files have been published in releases <v0.4 and on Debian/Ubuntu in release v0.6 as well.
In the "ENV style" Service Files, configuration was loaded in through an environment file and the values of the environment variables where shimmed in place of the flag values:
```bash
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vip-manager -ip="${VIP_IP}" -mask="${VIP_MASK}" -iface="${VIP_IFACE}" -key="${VIP_KEY}" -host="${VIP_HOST}" -type="${VIP_TYPE}" -endpoint="${VIP_ENDPOINT}"
```

As a result, these Service Files should be replaced by ones that specify no flags at all:
```bash
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vip-manager
```

Since the environment variables are still there, the vip-manager (>=v1.0) will pick them up itself. It will pick up the old keys and use only emit log messages indicating the deprecation of those keys.
> You could even consider another shim, that will take the environment variables using old keys, get their values and assign them to environment variables using the new keys. Then unset the old keys and you will no longer see deprecation messages.

#### Migration for Service Files using YAML config files:

> These Service FIles have been published in release v0.6
In these "config file style" Service Files, the yaml configuration file was passed as a flag to the vip-manager.
```bash
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vip-manager -config=/etc/default/vip-manager.yml
```

Because the old keys in the YAML config files will be remapped to new keys, all that needs to be done is to add a single dash (`sed -i 's/-config/--config/'`):
```bash
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vip-manager --config=/etc/default/vip-manager.yml
```

## Configuration - Hetzner

To use vip-manager with Hetzner's "Robot API":

* configure a credentials file (see below)
* set `manager-type` to `hetzner` in `/etc/default/vip-manager.yml`
* add the "Floating-IP" (aka the VIP or virtual IP) to the relevant network interface on each of your servers.

vip-manager will *not* add the VIP to or remove it from the network interface of the current cluster leader; vip-manager will only tell Hetzner to route traffic for the VIP to the current cluster leader.

### Credential File - Hetzner

Add the File `/etc/hetzner` with your Username and Password
```
user="myUsername"
pass="myPassword"
```

## Debugging

Either:

* run `vip-manager` with `--verbose` flag or
* set `verbose` to `true` in `/etc/default/vip-manager.yml`
* set `VIP_VERBOSE=true`

(currently only supported for `hetzner`)
