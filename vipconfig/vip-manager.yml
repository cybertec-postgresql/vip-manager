  # A single list-item is also fine.
  # consul will always only use the first entry from this list.
  # For consul, you'll obviously need to change the port to 8500. Unless you're using a different one. Maybe you're a rebel and are running consul on port 2379? Just to confuse people? Why would you do that? Oh, I get it.
