# time (in milliseconds) after which vip-manager wakes up and checks if it needs to register or release ip addresses.

# the etcd or consul key which vip-manager will regularly poll.
key: "/service/pgcluster/leader"
# if the value of the above key matches the NodeName (often the hostname of this host), vip-manager will try to add the virtual ip address to the interface specified in Iface

ip: 192.168.0.123 # the virtual ip address to manage
mask: 24 # netmask for the virtual ip
iface: enp0s3 #interface to which the virtual ip will be added

# how the virtual ip should be managed. we currently support "ip addr add/remove" through shell commands or the Hetzner api
hosting_type: basic # possible values: basic, hetzner .

endpoint_type: etcd # etcd, zookeper or consul
# a list that contains all endpoints to which etcd could talk. 
endpoints:
  - http://127.0.0.1:2379
  - http://192.168.0.42:2379
  # A single list-item is also fine.
  # consul will always only use the first entry from this list.
  # For consul, you'll obviously need to change the port to 8500. Unless you're using a different one. Maybe you're a rebel and are running consul on port 2379? Just to confuse people? Why would you do that? Oh, I get it.

#how often things should be retried and how long to wait between retries. (currently only affects arpClient)
